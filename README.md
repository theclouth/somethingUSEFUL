# somethingUSEFUL
# 基于高德地图的web服务api做的一个天气预报推送，通过配置文件决定跟踪哪一个城市，并在每天晚上23：55检查天气，如果出现下雨、低温、高温等天气，就会发送邮件到指定邮箱（通过配置文件自定义）。
# 如果使用其他的天气api，需要把网址URI换一下；

# A weather forecast push based on the Gaode Map(a chinese app) Web Service API, which determines which city to track through a configuration file and checks the weather at 23:55 every night. If it rains, the temperature is low, or it is extremely hot, an email will be sent to the specified email address (customized through the configuration file).
# If using other weather APIs, you need to change the URL URI.
# For users from other countries (regions), in addition to changing the website link, you also need to update the vocabulary of alert weather to match the vocabulary in the corresponding website's dictionary.
